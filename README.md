Here's the corrected version of the `README.md` file with the script block properly closed:

### README.md

Create a `README.md` file with the following content:

```markdown
# Removing a File and Its History from a GitLab Repository

## Objective
To completely delete a file from a GitLab project and remove it from all history, including local files and backups.

## Steps to Follow

### 1. Clone the Repository
Ensure you have the latest version of the repository locally:
```sh
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
```

### 2. Run the Cleanup Script
Use the provided bash script to remove the file and its history:
```sh
chmod +x cleanup_script.sh
./cleanup_script.sh path/to/file
```

## Important Notes
- Rewriting history is a **destructive action**. Ensure you have a backup before performing these steps.
- This process affects all branches. Adjust the `--all` option in the script if you need to target specific branches.
- Once these steps are completed, the file and its history will be removed from the Git repository. Local copies of the repository with the file still present will need to be re-cloned to reflect the changes.

By following these steps, our team can ensure that sensitive or unwanted files are completely removed from our GitLab project and its history, including local copies and backups.
```

### cleanup_script.sh

Create a `cleanup_script.sh` file with the following content:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Function to wait for user confirmation
wait_for() {
    read -p "Press Enter to continue..."
}

# Check if a file path was provided
if [ -z "$1" ]; then
    echo "Usage: $0 path/to/file"
    exit 1
fi

FILE_PATH=$1

# Clone the repository
echo "Cloning the repository..."
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory> || exit
wait_for

# Remove the file and its history
echo "Removing the file and its history..."
git filter-branch --force --index-filter \
'git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch '"$FILE_PATH" \
--prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all
wait_for

# Remove local copies of the file
echo "Removing local copies of the file..."
rm -f "$FILE_PATH"
wait_for

# Clean up and optimize the repository
echo "Cleaning up and optimizing the repository..."
rm -rf .git/refs/original/
git reflog expire --expire=now --all
git gc --prune=now --aggressive
wait_for

# Force push the changes
echo "Force pushing the changes..."
git push origin --force --all
git push origin --force --tags
wait_for

# Inform collaborators
echo "Inform all collaborators to re-clone the repository and delete their local copies of the file:"
echo "rm -f $FILE_PATH"
```

### Summary of Commands

Hereâ€™s a summary of the commands to create the files and push them to GitHub:

1. **Create and clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/new-repository.git
   cd new-repository
   ```

2. **Create `README.md` and `cleanup_script.sh` with the provided content.**

3. **Add, commit, and push the files:**
   ```sh
   git add README.md cleanup_script.sh
   git commit -m "Add instructions and script for removing a file and its history from a GitLab repository"
   git push origin main
   ```

By following these steps, you can create a new repository on GitHub with a README file and a bash script to automate the process of  removing a file and its history from a GitLab repository.
